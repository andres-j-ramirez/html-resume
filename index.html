     <h3>Professional Summary:</h3>
     <p> Starting in September of 2023, I began my journey to becoming a web developer. Western Governors Univeristy is where I began my venture and transition into the tech world. Previously, I had held jobs ranging from amazon driving, bookkeeping, and medical receptionist. All my experiences served me well in my studies and in July of 2024 I will be completing my Bachelors of Science in Information Technology. Complete dedication to my studies and an online platform allowed me to supercharge my transition into the technology industry at breakneck speeds.</p>
     <p>I began to code for the first time for courses in my degree program in Feburary of 2024. This helped me ralize that creating websites is something I thoughouly enjoyed and can become really good at. Since then, I have shifted all my extra focus on learning all I can about full-stack web development to be the best vesrsion of myself. Now I have completed the Web Development bootcamp (2024) by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. Now that I have professional experience in tech and a deep technical understanding and skills for web development, I am looking to apply my skils at a job and kickstart my career. Below is my official resume!</p>
